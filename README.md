Coding challenge for Fueled.

Written with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Installation instructions
There's not much to install! Clone the repo, open terminal in that folder, and spin up a local server with your preferred servering tool. I enjoy the convenience of the [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) plugin on VSCode, but you can use something like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to achieve the same effect.

...Or you can just double click the index.html file when in the folder, and it should open in your default browser ;)
